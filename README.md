# Business Analytics Projects

This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience with SQL, Excel dashboards, and Python-based statistical analysis—ideal for showcasing analytics skills for Business Analyst roles.

## How to View Projects
1. Open this repo to read the overview and project descriptions.
2. Sales Data Analysis: View `queries.sql` for SQL queries and `sample_sales_data.csv` for dataset.
3. Customer Retention Dashboard (Excel): Follow instructions in `dashboard_instructions.txt` to build the dashboard.
4. Statistical Analysis (Python): Open `analysis.ipynb` notebook on GitHub to see code and visualizations.

## Projects

### 1. Sales Data Analysis (SQL + Excel)
- Dataset: `sample_sales_data.csv`  
- Queries in `queries.sql` show revenue trends and leakage points.  
- Excel dashboards visualize key KPIs like monthly revenue, top products, and average order value.

### 2. Customer Retention Dashboard (Excel)
- Tracks churn rates, repeat purchases, and region-wise performance.  
- `dashboard_instructions.txt` provides step-by-step guidance to recreate the dashboard.

### 3. Statistical Analysis (Python)
- Jupyter Notebook: `analysis.ipynb`  
- Uses regression and probability models for revenue prediction.  
- Visualizations show data distributions and regression outputs.
